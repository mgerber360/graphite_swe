Files for the graphite digital technical focusing on the SWE track (ride share optimization algorithm)

The Python file has a class called "RidePricingOptimizer" that holds all the methods related to the optimization algorithm. 

The algorithm is a finite horizon dynamic programming algorithm that determines dynamic pricing tables for each time step
based on input parameters.

To run the optimization algorithm directly within the script, adjust class initialization values in main(): T, price_options, 
per_ride_op_cost, spillover_fraction, backlog_step, backlog_max, end_backlog_penalty, base_demands, and drivers.
